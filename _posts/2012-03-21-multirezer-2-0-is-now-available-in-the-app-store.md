Hello fellow developers! Today marks a *very* exciting day for me :relaxed: Not only have I reached over 1,000 MultiRezer users, but MultiRezer 2.0 has been released and is now available in the Mac App Store!

The code and rights to MultiRezer are no longer owned by me; but owned by <a href="http://project239.com">Project 239, Inc.</a> So if you have any questions/comments/problems with MultiRezer, go over to the <a href="http://project239.com/multirezer">MultiRezer product page</a> and bug them on there :wink:

It's been a long while since my last post, mostly because life has been pretty hectic... Which is the reason this took so long to get out! But this version now supports <strong>TEN</strong> different screen resolutions <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(including the new iPad 3!)</strong></span>! It supports every resolution that <a href="http://anscamobile.com">Corona SDK</a> can export to! (Since MultiRezer was originally made for Corona users). It also now features a full GUI!

Well guys, that's about it! Please support future development and purchase MultiRezer from the app store! Hopefully this version can speed up your graphic work even more!
